Actions on Google Client Library\n\nThis client library makes it easy to create your apps for the Google Assistant, and\nsupports both Dialogflow fulfillment and the Actions SDK webhook.\n\n* [Client Library GitHub repo](https://github.com/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs)\n* [Client Library reference docs](https://actions-on-google.github.io/actions-on-google-nodejs/)\n* [Actions on Google docs](https://developers.google.com/actions/)\n* [Actions on Google samples](https://developers.google.com/actions/samples/)\n\n[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/actions-on-google.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/actions-on-google)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs)\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\nInstall the library with either `npm install actions-on-google` or `yarn add actions-on-google` if you use yarn.\n\n### Dialogflow\n```javascript\n// Import the appropriate service and chosen wrappers\n\nconst {\n  dialogflow,\n  Image,\n} = require('actions-on-google')\n\n// Create an app instance\n\nconst app = dialogflow()\n\n// Register handlers for Dialogflow intents\n\napp.intent('Default Welcome Intent', conv => {\n  conv.ask('Hi, how is it going?')\n  conv.ask(`Here's a picture of a cat`)\n  conv.ask(new Image({\n    url: 'https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-builtin/imgs/160204193356-01-cat-500.jpg',\n    alt: 'A cat',\n  }))\n})\n\n// Intent in Dialogflow called `Goodbye`\napp.intent('Goodbye', conv => {\n  conv.close('See you later!')\n})\n\napp.intent('Default Fallback Intent', conv => {\n  conv.ask(`I didn't understand. Can you tell me something else?`)\n})\n```\n\n### Actions SDK\n```javascript\n// Import the appropriate service and chosen wrappers\n\nconst {\n  actionssdk,\n  Image,\n} = require('actions-on-google')\n\n// Create an app instance\n\nconst app = actionssdk()\n\n// Register handlers for Actions SDK intents\n\napp.intent('actions.intent.MAIN', conv => {\n  conv.ask('Hi, how is it going?')\n  conv.ask(`Here's a picture of a cat`)\n  conv.ask(new Image({\n    url: 'https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-builtin/imgs/160204193356-01-cat-500.jpg',\n    alt: 'A cat',\n  }))\n})\n\napp.intent('actions.intent.TEXT', (conv, input) => {\n  if (input === 'bye' || input === 'goodbye') {\n    return conv.close('See you later!')\n  }\n  conv.ask(`I didn't understand. Can you tell me something else?`)\n})\n```\n\n### Frameworks\n\nExport or run for your appropriate framework:\n\n#### Firebase Functions\n``` javascript\nconst functions = require('firebase-functions')\n\n// ... app code here\n\nexports.fulfillment = functions.https.onRequest(app)\n```\n\n#### Dialogflow Inline Editor\n```javascript\nconst functions = require('firebase-functions')\n\n// ... app code here\n\n// name has to be `dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment`\nexports.dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment = functions.https.onRequest(app)\n```\n\n#### Self Hosted Express Server\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express')\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser')\n\n// ... app code here\n\nexpress().use(bodyParser.json(), app).listen(3000)\n```\n\n#### AWS Lambda API Gateway\n```javascript\n// ... app code here\n\nexports.fulfillment = app\n```\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTake a look at the docs and samples linked at the top to get to know the platform and supported functionalities.\n\n## Library Development Instructions\nThis library uses `yarn` to run commands. Install yarn using instructions from https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install or with npm: `npm i -g yarn`.\n\nInstall the library dependencies with `yarn`. If you want to run any of the sample apps, follow the instructions in the sample README.\n\n## Functionality\n\nPublic interfaces, classes, functions, objects, and properties are labeled with the JSDoc `@public` tag and exported at the top level. Everything else that is not labeled `@public` and exported at the top level is considered internal and may be changed.\n\nThis library supports the following Services:\n* Dialogflow v1 and v2\n* Actions SDK **v2 only**\n\n### Actions SDK\nThis library supports only Actions SDK fulfillment version 2.\n\nTo ensure that your fulfillment uses version 2, set the [`\"fulfillmentApiVersion\": 2`](https://github.com/actions-on-google/actionssdk-eliza-nodejs/blob/a44a1b0ef0026ce2b0e525ce38bebbf8540ce344/eliza.json#L41) property in your action package.\n\n## References and How to report

SDK package is the standard distribution of ASK SDK v2 for Node.js.\n\n## What is ASK SDK v2 for Node.js\n\nThe ASK SDK v2 for Node.js is an open-source Alexa Skill Development Kit. ASK SDK v2 for Node.js makes it easier for you to build highly engaging skills, by allowing you to spend more time on implementing features and less on writing boiler-plate code.\n\n## Installing\nTo use the ASK SDK package, simply run the following command in terminal:\n\n```\nnpm install --save ask-sdk\n```\n\n## Usage and Getting Started\n\nYou can find a getting started guide [here](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs/wiki).\n\n## Usage with TypeScript\nThe ASK SDK package for Node.js bundles TypeScript definition files for use in TypeScript projects and to support tools that can read .d.ts files. Our goal is to keep these TypeScript definition files updated with each release for any public api.\n\n### Pre-requisites\nBefore you can begin using these TypeScript definitions with your project, you need to make sure your project meets a few of these requirements:\n- Use TypeScript v2.x\n- Includes the TypeScript definitions for node. You can use npm to install this by typing the following into a terminal window:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev @types/node\n```\n\n### In Node.js\nTo use the TypeScript definition files within a Node.js project, simply import ask-sdk as below:\n\nIn a TypeScript file:\n\n```typescript\nimport * as Alexa from 'ask-sdk';\n```\n\nIn a JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\nconst Alexa = require('ask-sdk');\n```\n\n## Opening Issues\nFor bug reports, feature requests and questions, we would like to hear about it. Search the [existing issues](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs/issues) and try to make sure your problem doesnât already exist before opening a new issue. Itâs helpful if you include the version of the SDK, Node.js or browser environment and OS youâre using. Please include a stack trace and reduced repro case when appropriate, too. \n\n## License\nThis SDK is distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, see LICENSE for more information.\n","owner":{"name":"alexa","avatar":"https://github.com/alexa.png","link":"https://github.com/alexa"},"deprecated":false,"homepage":"https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skill-sdk-for-nodejs#readme","license":"Apache-2.0","keywords":["Alexa","SDK"],"computedKeywords":[],"computedMetadata":{},"created":1524063998838,"modified":1526515036867,"lastPublisher":{"name":"amazonasksdk","email":"ask-sdk@amazon.com","avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/26e506275f06de0373ca0876b0765ef0","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/~amazonasksdk"},"owners":[{"name":"amazonasksdk","email":"ask-sdk@amazon.com","avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/26e506275f06de0373ca0876b0765ef0","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/~amazonasksdk"}],"lastCrawl":"2018-05-16T23:57:17.219Z","_searchInternal":{"concatenatedName":"asksdk","alternativeNames":["asksdk","ask sdk","ask-sdk"],"downloadsMagnitude":4},"dependents":0,"humanDependents":"0","changelogFilename":null,"objectID":"ask-sdk","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"<em>ask-sdk</em>","matchLevel":"full","fullyHighlighted":true,"matchedWords":["ask","sdk"]},"description":{"value":"Standard distribution package for Alexa Skills Kit SDK","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"owner":{"name":{"value":"alexa","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}},"keywords":[{"value":"Alexa","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"SDK","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"owners":[{"name":{"value":"amazonasksdk","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}],"_searchInternal":{"concatenatedName":{"value":"<em>asksdk</em>","matchLevel":"full","fullyHighlighted":true,"matchedWords":["ask","sdk"]}}}}}},"lambdaId":"182f4820-7ac1-44b6-8fcc-4b3f37017ca7"},"PROJECT_META":{"projectName":"testing","projectDescription":"","projectVersion":"1.0.0","projectRegion":"us-east-1","repoName":"testing","repoUrl":"https://github.com/usmannisar/testing","lastSave":1526800678952}}
